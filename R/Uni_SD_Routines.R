#' NNS FSD Test uni-directional
#'
#' Uni-directional test of first degree stochastic dominance using lower partial moments used in SD Efficient Set routine.
#'
#' @param x a numeric vector (or a single-column data frame, matrix or xts object). Factors and character data are an error, as are missing or infinite values.
#' @param y a numeric vector (or a single-column data frame, matrix or xts object). Factors and character data are an error, as are missing or infinite values.
#' @param type \code{"discrete"} (default) uses empirical FSD. At degree 1, \code{"continuous"} retains the degree-one area-ratio (Omega/expectile) ordering, which need not imply FSD or preference for every increasing utility. SSD and TSD are unaffected by \code{type}. Letter case is ignored; any other value is an error.
#' @return Returns (1) if X dominates Y in the selected order (ordinary FSD or Omega/expectile order), else (0).
#' @note The curves are compared on the merged sample points and, for TSD and continuous area order, also at their closed-form extrema between those points. Both samples are first centred on \code{c}, the midpoint of their pooled range. Differences smaller than \code{64 * .Machine$double.eps * S^d}, plus an allowance of order \code{4 * .Machine$double.eps * |c| * S^(d - 1)} for the rounding of the inputs themselves (\code{S} = half the pooled range of \code{x} and \code{y}, \code{d} = 1 for SSD and the mean condition, 2 for TSD; a ratio analogue for continuous area order) are treated as ties, so that rounding noise does not decide dominance. Discrete FSD compares exact empirical CDF values.
